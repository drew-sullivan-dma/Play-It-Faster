1) Ask the user if he/she knows what tempo to start with
2) if s/he does, give him/her the corresponding goal tempo for the day
3) if s/he doesn't, find the starting practice tempo for him/her
	a) Begin by finding the ultimateGoalTempo
	b) Split the ultimateGoalTempo in 2
		i) if it's too fast, move 2 met clicks slower, and repeat if necessary
		ii) if it's too slow, move 2 met clicks faster, and repeat if necessary
		iii) Once it's correct, return to step 2
		
NOTES:
1) All numbers received from the user must go through the metronome filter, 
meaning that the numbers are instantly translated to corresponding metronome marks, 
which are ints stored in a metronome tempo array
